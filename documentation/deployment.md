# Deploying Smart Contracts

## Configuration

### Setup hardhat.config.ts

1. Open `/hardhat.config.ts`
1. Add your desired network to the `config`object
    * `url` - the RPC endpoint of the blockchain client
    * `chainId` - the chainId of the blockchain network
    * `accounts` - array of private keys of the accounts used for deployment, tests and benchmark. Just 1 account is needed to deploy the contracts and execute the benchmark.
    * `timeout` - timeout used internally to wait for responses from the RPC client. E.g. 100_000


## Execute the deployment

`npx hardhat deploy --network <networkName>`

## Results of the deployment

A subfolder for each network the contracts are deployed at will be created when the deployment is executed (e.g. `/deployments/hl-besu`). In that folder, a json file containing the address of the deployed contract, the abi, the bytecode and other useful information is stored for each contract. Subsequent calls of the deployment task will not redeploy the contracts and replace the files, if they were already deployed with the same version of the code. If you wish to redeploy the same contracts on the same network, you have to delete or rename the files generated by the prior deployment.
